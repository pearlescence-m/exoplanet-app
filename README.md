_**exoplanet-app** is an interactive 3D visualization of exoplanets and planetary systems using data from [NASA](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_PS_columns.html)._

This application was created as a part of my self-directed study journey where I had a goal to learn more about 3D shaders, Three.js and React-Three/Fiber and Drei, and modern web technologies such as Next.js and TypeScript. I also used MongoDB and a library called mongoose to store and retrieve data.

I was always fascinated with stars and the worlds beyond ours that exist somewhere out there in the greater universe. This project is a tribute to the wonders of the human thought that created telescopes, Sci-Fi and Fermi paradox. Hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did!
